# Ones, Threes and Nines
Create a class called ones_three_nines

When creating an object, it will receive an integer. The object will have three attributes called ones, threes and nines. Each attribute will store the number of ones, threes, or nines that can "fit into" the number.

## Examples
```
n1 = ones_threes_nines(5)
n1.nines ➞ 0

n1.ones ➞ 5

n1.threes ➞ 1
```
